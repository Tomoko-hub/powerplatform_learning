# Power Pages × React Hands-on

This project documents a step-by-step hands-on session for embedding a custom React component into a Microsoft Power Pages site.

## 🔧 Goal

Render a React component inside Power Pages by building and uploading a JavaScript bundle manually.

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

### 1. Created a Power Pages site
- Started from a blank site
- Created pages:
  - `/login`
  - `/DisplayUsers`
- Created a Dataverse table `AccountUsers`
  - Added test data (User1, User2, User3)

---

### 2. Built a React component with Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-in-pages -- --template react
cd react-in-pages
npm install


3. Uploaded the React bundle to Power Pages
Opened Portal Management from Power Pages

Went to Web Files

Created a new Web File:

Name: reactbundle.js

Partial URL: reactbundle.js

Publishing State: Published

Uploaded index-xxxxx.js to File Content

Set Mime Type: application/javascript

⚠️ Needed to Save once to unlock the file upload area!

4. Embedded React component in Power Pages
In Power Pages Design Studio:

Added an HTML section to a page (e.g., DisplayUsers)

Inserted this:
<div id="react-root"></div>
<script src="/reactbundle.js"></script>

🧪 Results
✅ Successfully built and prepared a custom React bundle
🔄 Tried to embed it into Power Pages
⚠️ Could not finish displaying due to file upload issues (ongoing)

🚀 Next Steps
Fix file upload or MIME type issue

Confirm working script on Power Pages

Try fetching data from Dataverse inside React

📝 Notes
Power Pages only supports manual script injection (no native React)

Web Files must be Published even if the site is Private

JavaScript files must be uploaded via Portal Management
