# 📘 Daily Study Summary: Power Platform & PL-900 Prep (June 6, 2025)

## ✅ Topics Covered

### 🔹 Power Automate
- Understood the difference between **instant**, **automated**, **scheduled**, and **business process** flows.
- Learned when to use the **Select** action for transforming arrays, similar to `.map()` in JavaScript.
- Clarified the role of `Join`, `Parse JSON`, and `Filter array`.
- Discovered that **instant flows** are triggered manually (e.g., from a mobile app), not automatically.
- Realized the difference between **“join” in Power Automate** (text array joining) vs. SQL joins.

### 🔹 Power Apps
- Differentiated between **canvas apps** and **model-driven apps**:
  - Canvas = Flexible UI, external data sources like SharePoint
  - Model-driven = Structured UI, Dataverse-based, suited for guided processes
- Learned that **shared ownership** is only for **canvas apps**, while model-driven apps rely on **security roles**.

### 🔹 Power BI
- Reviewed when to use:
  - **Line charts** for time-series trends
  - **Maps** for geographical distribution
  - ✅ Not KPI cards or pie charts for year-over-year revenue and customer data
- Understood that:
  - A **report** supports multiple pages and filters.
  - A **dashboard** is a one-page view with pinned visuals from multiple reports.

### 🔹 Security Roles
- Security roles are essential for model-driven apps and Dataverse:
  - Control access to data, apps, and actions.
  - Unlike canvas apps, **model-driven apps require explicit role assignment** for usage.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Identified and corrected several conceptual misunderstandings (e.g., flow types, Power BI visuals, app types).
- Gained confidence in terminology and use cases through real Microsoft Learn-style questions.
- Clarified UI similarities (e.g., `Select` in Power Automate ≈ `.map()` in JS) to deepen understanding.
- Practiced distinguishing similar-sounding concepts based on their **function, not just name**.

## 🧠 Reflection

> Today was the first time I felt I truly “understood” the core ideas of the Power Platform rather than memorizing terms.  
> Connecting concepts like flows, app types, and Power BI visuals to their actual use cases helped everything click.
