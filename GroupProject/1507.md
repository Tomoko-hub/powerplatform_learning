📘 ReadMe: Notification Flow Implementation (Power Apps & Power Automate)
✅ Objective:
Create an automated notification system that sends an email to a course teacher when a student reports course completion.

🧩 Tools Used:
Power Apps

Power Automate

Dataverse (Tables)

Outlook (for email notification)

🛠️ Key Components:
1. Dataverse Tables Used:
AuroraInstitute_Notifications: Stores messages sent by students.

AuroraInstitute_Users: Stores user info (students, teachers).

AuroraInstitute_Course: Course data.

Lookup columns:

User: links to student

CourseRef: links to course

LecturerRef: links to teacher

2. Power Automate Flow (Trigger: Dataverse):
Trigger: When a new row is added to AuroraInstitute_Notifications

Steps:

Get the student's full name via lookup

Get the course title from CourseRef

Get the teacher’s full name and email via LecturerRef

Send an email to the teacher

3. Power Automate Flow (Trigger: Power Apps - optional test setup):
Triggered by a button in Power Apps using:
getNotifyFromStudentAppTest.Run(User().Email)

Input: Email address (used to find the student in Dataverse)

Advantage: Allows test execution without inserting actual rows

💡 Lessons Learned:
When using Lookups, related table data (e.g., FullName, Email) can be retrieved with the "Get row" or "List rows" action.

If using Power Apps to trigger a flow, inputs like email must match data stored in Dataverse, or filtering will fail.

Adding a condition (like "if row found") is useful to avoid errors in flows.

It’s okay to leave the False path empty if no alternative action is needed.

Everything (student, course, teacher) is best managed through Lookups for data consistency.

📝 Example Email Output:
Hey, teacher Anna Virtanen,

Student Sofia Korhonen has reported course completion.

Details:
Student Name: Sofia Korhonen
Course: test 2
Teacher: Anna Virtanen
Teacher Email: anna.virtanen@example.com

Message: Request sent.
Date: 2025-07-14

🔚 Conclusion:
This system now successfully sends automatic emails based on student actions. Further improvements can be made later (e.g., testing via Power Apps trigger), but the core functionality is complete and effective.
