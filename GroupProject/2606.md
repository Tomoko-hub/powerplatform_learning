Development and troubleshooting of a Power Apps canvas application for course management by instructors (Kouluttaja role).

## ‚úÖ Today's Accomplishments

### 1. **Navigation and Component Logic**
- Created functional **Footer** with Home and Logout icons.
- Used `Navigate()` for screen transitions.
- Applied `Set(currentUser, Blank())` and `Notify()` for logout behavior.

### 2. **Header and Footer Responsiveness**
- Set dynamic widths using `App.Width` and `Parent.Width`.
- Adjusted alignment within containers to ensure consistent appearance across screens.

### 3. **Delete Confirmation Workflow**
- Implemented a custom delete confirmation using:
  - `UpdateContext({ showDeleteConfirm: true })`
  - Conditional visibility for warning container
  - Two buttons: **Confirm (Poista)** and **Cancel (Peruuta)**
  - Used `Remove()` and `Notify()` inside confirm button to handle deletion and feedback.

### 4. **Filtering Data by Logged-In User**
- Used `Filter(AuroraInstitute_Courses, CreatedBy = currentUser.Email)` to display instructor-specific data.
- Confirmed `currentUser` is correctly passed from login screen using `Set()`.

### 5. **SubmitForm & Patch Exploration**
- Identified limitation: `SubmitForm` triggers `statecode` error due to system-generated field.
- Decided to switch to `Patch()` for manual data insertion, with full control over submitted fields.

### 6. **Data Handling Observations**
- `CreatedBy` field type confirmed as text/email, not user object.
- Explored potential use of `Patch()` or `Collect()` for inserting new records into Dataverse table.

## üß† Learnings & Notes

- System fields like `statecode` in Dataverse **must not be assigned manually**.
- `Patch()` provides more flexibility than `SubmitForm()` in apps requiring custom logic.
- **Context variables** (`UpdateContext`) are crucial for managing modal state.
- `Notify()` is helpful for user feedback upon success/failure.

## üìå Next Steps

- Finalize `Patch()` implementation for course creation.
- Add validation for required fields before record submission.
- Test and polish UI responsiveness across different screens.

## üí¨ Comments

Great progress made on integrating UX/UI components, data logic, and user-specific filters. Tomorrow's focus can be on refining the Patch implementation and completing the course creation workflow.
