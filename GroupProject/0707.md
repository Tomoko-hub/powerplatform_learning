ðŸ“˜ ReadMe â€“ July 7th, Sprint 4 (Unofficial Day 1)
âœ… Goal:
Display notification details on screen, and make only the IsRead field editable.

ðŸ›  Work Summary:
1. Displayed Notification Details
Set up a screen to show properties of AuroraInstitute_Notification.

Used Gallery.Selected to display selected notification details in a form.

Confirmed that CourseRef, LecturerRef, NotificationType, and User can be displayed as read-only fields.

2. Handled Lookup & Choice Fields
Used expressions like ThisItem.CourseRef.Title or Gallery.Selected.CourseRef.Title to access related table data.

For Choice fields: displayed values using ThisItem.NotificationType or ThisItem.IsRead.Value.

3. Restricted Edit Access
Set all fields' DisplayMode to View, except IsRead, which was set to Edit.

4. Updated Only IsRead Field
Replaced SubmitForm() with a custom Patch() to update only the IsRead field:

Patch(
    AuroraInstitute_Notifications,
    RecordsGallery5.Selected,
    {
        IsRead: DataCardValueIsRead.Selected.Value  // Replace with actual control name
    }
)

Alternatively, kept SubmitForm(Form5) and made sure all other fields were read-only.

Issues Encountered:
CurrentItem caused errors â†’ switched to Gallery.Selected for reliable binding.

Fields sometimes didn't show in test mode because Form.Item wasn't set properly.

DisplayFields errors were due to missing or misnamed fields.

âœ… Next Steps:
Improve OnSuccess handling (e.g. add Notify()).

Optionally auto-select first gallery item on screen load:

Select(First(RecordsGallery5.AllItems))

Clean up unused input controls (like hidden ComboBoxes).
