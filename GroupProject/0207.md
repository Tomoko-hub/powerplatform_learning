‚úÖ Completed Tasks
Implemented Notification on Enrollment (Ilmoittautuminen):
When a student clicks the "Ilmoittaudu" button, a new record is successfully created in the AuroraInstitute_Notifications table using a Patch() function.

Confirmed Functionality:

Notification includes course title, student email, date, unread flag, and notification type "Ilmoittautuminen".

Status field in the AuroraInstitute_Enrollments table is not set at this stage (left blank).

The current setup works without errors when only the first Patch() (to Notifications) is used.

üß© Investigated Issues
Patch errors occurred when trying to set Status and User in AuroraInstitute_Enrollments due to:

User column being a text (email) field, not a Lookup.

Attempting to Patch() a record (or LookUp() result) into a text field caused type mismatch.

The course field Course is a Lookup field, which means selectedCourse must be a full record, not just text.

‚úèÔ∏è Key Decisions
We decided not to set Status during the student's registration step.

This allows the instructor to control status later (e.g., "Odottaa", "Hyv√§ksytty", "Hyl√§tty").

Avoids unnecessary Patch complexity and data mismatch errors.

üîú Plan for Tomorrow
Instructor app enhancement:

Highlight enrollments where Status is empty or "Odottaa".

Enable instructors to change the Status via dropdown or buttons.

Improve UI to clearly indicate new/untreated applications.

Optional: Add visual indicators or filtered views for new notifications.
