Power Apps & Power Automate Self-Study Progress
âœ… What I worked on today:
Implemented notification count badge in a Power Apps canvas app using:

CountRows(Filter(...)) for unread notifications

Conditional visibility based on IsRead = false

Explored OnVisible logic to initialize notification count globally via Set()

Learned about container structure and grouping behavior, including:

Why some controls cannot be moved

How to align controls using X/Y expressions relative to icons

Considered performance: chose to use a lightweight variable instead of a full collection

ðŸ§¡ Bonus feature:
Instead of a notification badge, built a temporary popup message (3-second display)

Used a Timer control triggered by a global variable

Displayed an alert when the screen loads and there are unread notifications

Auto-hides after 3 seconds with no user action required

ðŸ’¡ What I learned:
Practical use of OnVisible and global variables (Set())

UI/UX decision-making: badge vs. popup

How to structure components cleanly for dynamic UI placement

Timer-driven UI behavior with conditional logic
