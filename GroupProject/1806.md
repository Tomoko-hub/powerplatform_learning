**Auroral Institute – Learning Management App**  
**Date:** June 18, 2025  

---

## ✅ Overview

This document outlines the foundational setup completed in Microsoft Dataverse for the Auroral Institute project. The objective is to structure the core data model and entity relationships necessary for the development of a learning management application.

## 🧱 Custom Tables Created

| Table Name                         | Description                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `AuroralInstitute_User`           | User profiles (instructors and students)     |
| `AuroralInstitute_Course`         | Course information (title, type, etc.)       |
| `AuroralInstitute_Enrollment`     | Registration records (user-course links)     |
| `AuroralInstitute_Notification`   | Notifications (recipients, message content)  |
| `AuroralInstitute_Certificate`    | Certificates issued to users per course      |

## 🔗 Defined Relationships

| From → To Relationship              | Type           | Description                                   |
|------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `Enrollment → User`                | Many-to-One    | A user can have many enrollments              |
| `Enrollment → Course`              | Many-to-One    | A course can have many registered users       |
| `Course → CreatedBy (User)`        | Many-to-One    | An instructor can create multiple courses     |
| `Certificate → User`               | Many-to-One    | A user can receive multiple certificates      |
| `Certificate → Course`             | Many-to-One    | A certificate is linked to one course         |
| `Notification → User`              | Many-to-One    | Each notification is addressed to one user    |

> ℹ️ Note: Relationships were created using LookUp fields in Dataverse. One-to-Many relationships are automatically inferred.

## 🔑 Alternate Key Configuration

- An **alternate key** was set on the `AuroralInstitute_User` table using the `Email` field.
- **Reason:** Authentication and app logic will be based on email address, not a system-generated ID.

---

## 🏷 Naming Convention

- All table names start with the prefix `AuroralInstitute_` for easier identification across apps.
- Relationship and LookUp column names were renamed where needed for clarity (e.g., `Enrolled_Course`, `Created_By`, etc.).

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Implement login screens for:
  - Instructor via **Canvas App (Web)**
  - Student via **Canvas App (Mobile)**
- Test authentication and user-specific data filtering.
- Extend mock data and validate CRUD operations in the app.
