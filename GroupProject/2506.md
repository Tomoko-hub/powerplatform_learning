✅ Daily Summary – Power Apps UI & Styling Improvements
🧩 1. Unified App Styling with Variables
Created global variables in App.OnStart to control font, font size, and color:

    Set(AppFont, Font.'Open Sans');
    Set(AppFontSize, 14);
    Set(AppFontColor, RGBA(0,0,0,1));

These variables were applied throughout the app using control properties like:

Font = AppFont

FontSize = AppFontSize

Color = AppFontColor

🧱 2. Header Component Design
Started building a reusable header with:

App logo

Logged-in user name (from CurrentUser.FullName)

Page title

Design challenges were addressed with:

Dynamic X positioning (Logo.X + Logo.Width + 10)

Background color and spacing adjustments

⚙️ 3. Page Title Handling (planned but paused)
Considered passing PageTitle as a custom property to the header component

Deferred full componentization for future when workload allows

🧪 4. Lessons Learned
Responsive design in Power Apps needs careful layout planning

Container controls can impact layout if not managed properly

Component-based UI is powerful but requires variable passing and planning
