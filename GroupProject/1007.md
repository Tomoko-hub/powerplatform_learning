# Power Apps + Power Automate: Notification App for Course Enrollments

## 📌 Summary

This app allows instructors to manage course enrollment notifications within an educational platform. It is built using **Power Apps** and integrates with **Power Automate** to send emails based on enrollment status changes.

## 📚 What I Learned Today

### 🔄 1. Returning values from Power Automate to Power Apps
- I created a flow in Power Automate that sends an email based on a condition.
- I added a **"Respond to Power Apps"** action and returned a custom value (`notifyResult = "Success"`).
- Learned that:
  - The response must be **used** in the flow, otherwise Power Automate gives a warning.
  - In Power Apps, the returned value can be captured using `Set(result, Flow.Run(...))`.

### 💬 2. Handling response logic in Power Apps
- Power Apps was unable to read `notifyResult` due to incorrect casing or structure.
- To fix this, I handled the notification directly in Power Apps instead of relying on the return value from Power Automate.

### 🗃 3. Filtering relational data in galleries
- I attempted to display only those enrollments where the instructor is the creator of the related course.
- Learned that a **Lookup (relationship)** must be defined in Dataverse to access related fields like `Course.CreatedBy`.

### 💶 4. Formatting text with data
- Displayed price information with the euro symbol using:
  Text(ThisItem.EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp.Price, "€0")
Learned that number-to-text conversion is necessary to concatenate strings like "€".

❌ 5. Common issues I faced
Used ThisItem.SomeField in a context where ThisItem was not available (outside a gallery or form).

Fixed by referencing the correct context or using bound controls like Parent.Default.

✅ Tools Used
Power Apps (Canvas App)

Power Automate (Cloud Flow)

Dataverse Tables: AuroraInstitute_Course, AuroraInstitute_Enrollments, etc.

🧠 Next Steps
Revisit lookup relationships to enable richer filtering logic.

Improve error handling and user feedback within the app.

Optimize form visibility and conditional UI controls.
