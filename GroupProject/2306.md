âœ… Daily Progress Summary â€“ June 23, 2025
ðŸŽ¯ Focus Area: Power Apps â€“ Login System and Data Integration
1. Login System (UserLogin_Oppilas & Kouluttaja)
Implemented email-based login for students and trainers.

Used LookUp() to match user email and store in currentUser variable.

Applied Value property for TextInput to resolve formula errors.

On successful login:

Displayed LoginSuccess screen for 3 seconds using a Timer.

Timer's OnTimerEnd triggers Navigate(UserDashboard).

2. Logout Implementation
Added logout button with the following OnSelect action:

powerapps:
    Set(currentUser, Blank());
    Navigate(LogoutSuccess);

Concluded that Timer is not necessary for logout flows.

Used Navigate() directly for a smoother user experience.

3. LoginFailed Screen
Created user-friendly error screen if login fails.

Added "Home" link to return to login.

Used Navigate() instead of Launch() since internal screen navigation was needed.

4. Trainer Dashboard (Kouluttaja)
Created a UserDashboard screen for trainers.

Displayed welcome message using fields from currentUser.

Inserted a gallery to show course list.

5. Course Data (Dataverse)
Used AuroraInstitute_Courses table.

Added new column: CoursePicture (type: Image).

Learned that:

Inline editing is read-only for image columns.

Best practice: use Power Apps form for image upload/edit.

6. Form Configuration
Added Form1 to the trainer dashboard.

Learned that "This form isnâ€™t connected to any data yet" appears when:

DataSource is not set.

Item is not defined.

Setup Reminder:
    Form1.DataSource = AuroraInstitute_Courses
    Form1.Item = Gallery1.Selected
âœ… Decisions & Learnings
Using Set(varDevMode, true) is optional unless development conditions require it.

Timer must be reset (e.g. using Reset(TimerName)) if it needs to repeat.

Visual inconsistencies may occur even in mobile viewâ€”verify screen sizes and responsiveness carefully.

Course picture updates will be done by trainers only, using Edit mode (FormMode.Edit), not Create.
