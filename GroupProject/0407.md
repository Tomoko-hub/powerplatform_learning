ðŸ“˜ Sprint 3 - Day Final Summary (July 4, 2025)
âœ… Main Accomplishments
Notification System Implementation (Instructor Side):

Set up AuroraInstitute_Notifications to notify instructors when a student registers for a course.

Confirmed the use of LecturerRef as a lookup column pointing to the instructorâ€™s user record.

Verified that instructor email can be referenced via LecturerRef.Email.

Patch Logic Finalized (Student App):

When a student registers, a Notification and a corresponding Enrollment record are created.

CourseRef and LecturerRef are now linked to Dataverse records properly.

Patch(
    AuroraInstitute_Notifications,
    Defaults(AuroraInstitute_Notifications),
    {
        Message: "Ilmoittautuminen kurssille: " & selectedCourse.Title,
        User: currentUser.Email,
        SentOn: Today(),
        IsRead: false,
        NotificationType: "Ilmoittautuminen",
        CourseRef: LookUp(AuroraInstitute_Courses, Title = selectedCourse.Title),
        LecturerRef: LookUp(AuroraInstitute_Users, Email = selectedCourse.CreatedBy)
    }
)

Instructor Notification Screen UI:

Displaying unread notifications (IsRead = false) for current instructor using:
Filter(
    AuroraInstitute_Notifications,
    LecturerRef.Email = currentUser.Email && IsRead = false
)

ðŸ”„ Planned Next Steps
Add ability for instructors to mark notifications as read.

Add click action on notification to navigate to Enrollment review.

Improve NotificationType by converting from string to Choice field to avoid typos and enable filtering.

Clean up User column (deprecated) from Notification table.
