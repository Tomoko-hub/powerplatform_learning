📘 ReadMe: Sprint 3 – Day 3 (July 3, 2025)
🎯 Goal for Today
To implement a working notification system using PowerApps and Power Automate that informs lecturers when a student enrolls in a course. Also, to improve UI and data structure for better linking and display of course and lecturer information.

✅ What We Did
1. Improved Course Enrollment Logic (PowerApps)
Used Patch() to insert records into AuroraInstitute_Enrollments.

Learned how to use Lookup() correctly:

Distinguished between table, record, and text types.

Properly passed the selected course and lecturer reference.

2. Extended Notification Table Structure
Added the following fields to AuroraInstitute_Notifications:

LecturerRef (Lookup to AuroraInstitute_User)

CourseRef (Lookup to AuroraInstitute_Course)

Prepared for linking notifications to both lecturer and course details.

3. Created Lecturer Notification UI
Built a gallery view for notifications filtered by current lecturer:

powerapps
Copy
Edit
Filter(
   AuroraInstitute_Notifications,
   LecturerRef.Email = currentUser.Email
)
Verified that LecturerRef.Email is accessible (record type).

4. Started Automating Notification Flow
Began setting up Flow ① in Power Automate:

Triggered by new rows in AuroraInstitute_Enrollments.

Will create a record in AuroraInstitute_Notifications (lecturer notified of enrollment).

📝 Next Steps
Complete Flow ①: create lecturer notification automatically.

Build Flow ②: when Status is updated, notify the student.

Enable “Mark as Read” toggle UI for notifications.

Add link to course detail screen using CourseRef.

💡 Lessons Learned
Understanding how Lookup fields behave in PowerApps is essential.

Use Record.Property when accessing values from Lookup types.

Carefully structuring Dataverse tables makes building UI much smoother.
