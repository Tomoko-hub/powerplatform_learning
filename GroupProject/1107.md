# 📘 Power Apps Development Log – July 11, 2025

## ✅ Summary of Today’s Work

### 1. 🔁 `LecturerCreatedBy` Field Setup
- Created `LecturerCreatedBy` column in `AuroraInstitute_Enrollment` table.
- Set it up as a **Lookup** to `AuroraInstitute_Users`.
- Configured it to save the current user's record via:
  ```powerapps
  LookUp(AuroraInstitute_Users, Email = currentUser.Email)
2. 🧩 Patch Logic Implementation
Used Patch() instead of SubmitForm() to avoid overwriting unrelated fields.

Now only LecturerRef and Status are updated.

3. 📥 Power Automate Notification
Confirmed Automate notifications are working correctly.

Ensured the linked user (lecturer) appears in student messages.

4. 🧪 Displaying Lecturer Name in Student App
Adjusted the LecturerRef combo box to show FullName.

Used this lookup to fetch the lecturer name from enrollment:

LookUp(AuroraInstitute_Users, Email = SelectedEnrollment.LecturerCreatedBy.CreatedBy, FullName)

5. 🧼 Cleaning Up User Info in Header
Tried to show current user's name in the app header.

Found that currentUser becomes blank on logout due to:
Set(currentUser, Blank())

Decided to postpone the fix for tomorrow.

🌙 Notes
Some LecturerRef values were blank due to recent schema changes.

A few manual data entries were needed to verify display behavior.

Future improvement: avoid resetting currentUser unless necessary.
