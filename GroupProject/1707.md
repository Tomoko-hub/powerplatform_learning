# Power Platform Learning – Sprint Documentation Day

## 📅 Date
July 17, 2025

## 📚 What I Worked On Today

- Created a custom Copilot chatbot using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**
- Learned how to retrieve the **Schema Name** and **Environment ID** for Power Apps integration
- Investigated the current limitations of embedding chatbots in **Canvas Apps**
- Confirmed that chatbot embedding is now supported only in **Modern Pages Apps**
- Collaborated on team documentation planning and distribution
- Created:
  - 📝 Word script template for 3-minute demo video
  - 📊 PowerPoint template for portfolio-style presentation
  - ✅ Finnish checklist for recording video demos

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Always check platform updates: documentation from May 2025 may no longer reflect current Power Platform behavior
- Schema Name & Environment ID are essential for chatbot control setup
- Planning for handover is just as important as building
- Video scripting and structured documentation are powerful tools for both internal use and job applications

## 🎯 Next Steps

- Switch to **Modern Pages App** for chatbot embedding
- Finalize and record 3-minute demo video
- Complete team documentation and divide roles
- Polish materials into a **recruitment-ready portfolio**

## 🙌 Reflection

Although I built most of the solution on my own, today I focused on preparing templates and guides to support my team. I also gained clarity on how to turn this project into a strong portfolio piece for future job applications.
