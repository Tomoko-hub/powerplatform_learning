## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. Add New Course Functionality
- Implemented `+ Luo uusi koulutus` button to initialize a blank form for creating new courses.
- Ensured proper order of commands in `OnSelect`:
  ```powerapps
  UpdateContext({ CurrentItem: Blank() });
  ResetForm(Form2);
  NewForm(Form2);

  Corrected the Form2.Item logic to handle new vs. existing items:
  If(!IsBlank(CurrentItem), CurrentItem, Defaults(AuroraInstitute_Courses))


2. Dynamic Label Formatting
Fixed an issue where combining number and string types caused an error.

Used Text() to format numerical values (e.g. course price):

"‚Ç¨ " & Text(ThisItem.Price, "[$-fi-FI]#,##0.00")

3. UI Tweaks
Attempted to change label color but discovered that DisplayMode, Visible, and data context all affect formatting.

Used white font against a dark background and reviewed property dependencies.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges
Displaying Related Data (Instructor Name)
Tried to use LookUp() to fetch instructor full name from a separate Users table.

Faced type mismatch issues due to incompatible field types (text vs. record).

Decided to leave this part for later, as it was not critical for current functionality.

üí° Notes
Power Apps strongly depends on the correct order of commands like ResetForm() and NewForm().

LookUp() across tables works well if field types and relationships are clearly defined.

Preview mode in Studio may show data that doesn't behave the same way in published apps‚Äîtest carefully.

üìå Next Steps
Revisit the instructor name binding using a proper lookup or relationship.

Consider formalizing CreatedBy as a Lookup column in the Course table for easier data joins.

Polish the user interface for mobile usability and accessibility.
