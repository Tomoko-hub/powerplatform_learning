🔐 User Login & Role-Based Navigation

Stored current user data in the currentUser variable.

Applied role-based navigation:

If the user exists: Navigate to success screen.

    currentUser,
    LookUp(
        AuroraInstitute_Users,

);

If(
    !IsBlank(currentUser),
    Navigate(LoginSuccess),
    Notify("User not found", NotificationType.Error)
