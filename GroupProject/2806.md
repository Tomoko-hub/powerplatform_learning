# Aurora Institute Course Enrollment App

This Power Apps canvas application enables course creators at the Aurora Institute to manage enrollment requests for the courses they have published. 

## 🧩 Functionality Overview

- Display course enrollments submitted by users.
- Filter enrollments to show only those submitted to **courses created by the currently logged-in user**.
- Establish a lookup relationship between enrollments and course records to enable filtering based on the course's creator.

## ⚙️ Data Tables and Relationships

### 1. `AuroraInstitute_Course`
- Contains course details.
- Key column: `CreatedBy` (stores the creator's email/user info).

### 2. `AuroraInstitute_Enrollment`
- Stores course enrollment records.
- Key columns:
  - `User` (who enrolled)
  - `Course` (text, legacy)
  - `EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp` (lookup to `AuroraInstitute_Course`)

### 🔗 Relationship Setup
- A **Lookup column** (`EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp`) was created on the `Enrollment` table pointing to `AuroraInstitute_Course`.
- This enables filtering enrollments by course creator.

## 📄 Power Fx Logic

### Gallery Items Property

```powerfx
Filter(
    AuroraInstitute_Enrollments,
    EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp.CreatedBy.Email = currentUser.Email
)

Set(currentUser, User())

📝 Manual Data Setup
After adding the lookup column:

Go to Dataverse > AuroraInstitute_Enrollment.

For each row, select the appropriate course record in the EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp column.

Match it by course name to the existing Course text value.

📌 Notes
CreatedBy is a complex field — accessing its .Email property requires a valid lookup.

Using User().Email directly in filter works if the app is run in an authenticated user context (or simulated in dev with a variable).

✅ Next Steps (Optional)
Add filtering by status (Odottaa, Hyväksytty, Hylätty)

Add buttons to approve or reject enrollments (Patch() logic)

Improve UI/UX with course summaries and user profiles

💡 Tip
If the formula fails or returns no records, ensure:

Lookup field is populated for all records.

CreatedBy is not null and includes the expected email.

You're matching the email format correctly.
