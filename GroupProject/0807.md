📘 README – Power Platform App Development Progress (July 8, 2025)
✅ Summary of Today's Progress
This session focused on enhancing the Power Apps + Power Automate solution that manages student course enrollments and notifications to lecturers.

📌 Main Updates
🧑‍🎓 Student-Side Improvements
Patch Logic Updated for course enrollment submission:

Registered key fields including:

Course

User (student email)

EnrollmentDate

EnrolledCourse_CourseLookUp

EnrolledUserRef

AuroraInstitute_Enrolled_User

Initial attempt to assign the lecturer’s email via selectedCourse.CreatedBy was reviewed.

👨‍🏫 Lecturer-Side Enhancements
Form Submission Check:

Added conditional logic to allow only users with role "Kouluttaja" (lecturer) to submit the form.

Used SubmitForm(Form3) and warning notifications if unauthorized.

Lecturer Information Handling:

Realized that LecturerCreatedBy can be filled when the lecturer updates the student's enrollment Status.

This avoids the need to capture the lecturer's email during the student-side patch.

🔁 Data Model Consideration
The AuroraInstitute_Enrollments table contains:

AuroraInstitute_Enrolled_User (reference to student)

LecturerCreatedBy (string or reference to course/lecturer)

Challenge Identified:

Course titles may not be unique.

Therefore, depending solely on course titles for identifying lecturers is unreliable.

✅ Solution: Register LecturerCreatedBy during status update by the lecturer instead of during student submission.

🔄 Flow Integration
Created and tested a Power Automate Flow:

Trigger: "When a row is modified" in Enrollment table.

If the Status is updated by the lecturer:

Use Get a row by ID to retrieve full record.

Add a new row to AuroraInstitute_Notifications.

📈 To-Do (Tomorrow)
Finalize Power Automate Flow:

Ensure notification contains Message, User, LecturerRef, and CourseRef.

Test full workflow:

Enrollment → Status update → Notification creation.

Optionally improve data structure:

Consider using GUID or lookup references for consistency.
