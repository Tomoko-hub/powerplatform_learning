✅ Sending Instructor Info from Power Apps to Power Automate
Scenario:
The app is used by instructors to manage course enrollments. When a course is approved, a confirmation email is sent via Power Automate. The instructor’s name is required in the email.

Problem:
RecordsGallery3.Selected.Instructor.FullName was returning blank. This happens when the related field (Instructor) is empty or not correctly populated.

Solution:
Use the current user's details instead, because the app is operated by the instructor.

Power Apps - Run Function:
'PowerAppV2->Sendanemail(V2)'.Run(
    RecordsGallery3.Selected.EnrolledUserRef.FullName,     // Student's full name
    RecordsGallery3.Selected.Course,                       // Course name
    User().FullName,                                       // Instructor's full name (current user)
)

Why this works:
User().FullName dynamically gets the logged-in user (the instructor).

It avoids dependency on possibly empty or misconfigured data relationships.


Power Automate Parameters:
FullName – Student’s name

CourseName – Course title

TeacherName – Instructor’s name (User().FullName)
