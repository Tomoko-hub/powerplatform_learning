ðŸ“˜ Daily Summary â€“ June 30, 2025
ðŸ›  Power Apps Development Progress
âœ… What was done today:
Form Logic Debugging:

Investigated errors related to the SelectedCourse and CurrentItem variables.

Resolved confusion between Set() and UpdateContext() for storing selected item data locally.

Switched to using CurrentItem as a screen-local variable to manage record context without global scope.

Form Mode Handling:

Improved control logic to toggle between View and Edit mode using ViewForm(Form2) and EditForm(Form2).

Corrected conditional logic using Form2.Mode and ensured the correct use of enums like FormMode.View.

"New Record" Button:

Finalized formula for creating a new item:
    NewForm(Form2);
    ResetForm(Form2);
    Set(CurrentItem, Blank());
    UpdateContext({ itemSelected: false });

Ensured that the form resets and clears any previously selected data.

Record Selection Logic:

Ensured that selecting an item in Gallery sets CurrentItem and switches the form to View mode.

Tooltips & Localization:

Created a Finnish tooltip for the edit/view toggle button:

"Voit lisÃ¤tÃ¤ uuden koulutuksen painamalla plus(+) -painiketta."

Bug Fixing:

Resolved Power Apps formula errors related to mismatched data types and item defaults (e.g., gallery .Default issues).

Identified that some error messages were inherited from the default template and not blocking functionality.

ðŸ”„ Next Steps:
Implement conditional visibility or styling for buttons based on Form2.Mode.

Finalize Delete logic for Notifications once all context variables and galleries are aligned.

Review and cleanup unused variables (SelectedCourse, itemSelected, etc.) to prevent confusion.
