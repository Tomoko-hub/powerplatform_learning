# 📩 PowerApps × Power Automate – Event Creation & Mail Integration

This project integrates **Microsoft Power Apps** and **Power Automate** to build a mobile-friendly inventory app. It features UI state control, conditional navigation, and automated event creation via Outlook Calendar or mail functionality.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🎨 Power Apps UI with Gallery, Detail view, and Pop-up windows
- 📨 Conditional navigation to a **mail screen** via gallery icon
- 🔁 Input fields reset after form submission
- 📅 Power Automate flow for creating calendar events (Outlook)
- 🔗 Connected to SharePoint as the backend list

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### Power Apps

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Gallery | Displays inventory list (SharePoint source) |
| Set / Context Variables | Used for controlling screen logic and UI flags |
| Conditional Navigation | Icon-based navigation to MailScreen, separate from item selection |
| Reset Inputs | After submission, text inputs are cleared using `Set(resetXYZ, true)` |
| Visual Feedback | Popups and warnings using `Notify(...)` and `UpdateContext(...)` |

### Power Automate

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣ | Triggered by Power Apps |
| 2️⃣ | Input parameters collected (subject, body, time, etc.) |
| 3️⃣ | Create event in Outlook Calendar (or send email) |
| ✅ | Status returned back to Power Apps |

---

## 🔁 Gallery Control Logic

```powerapps
// Gallery OnSelect
If(
    Not(varBypassGalleryClick),
    Set(selectedItem, ThisItem);
    Navigate(DetailScreen1, ScreenTransition.None)
)

🧾 Tips & Best Practices
Use Set() for global variables, UpdateContext() for screen-local logic

Use Refresh(DataSource) after editing SharePoint columns

Make use of Reset property in inputs for cleaner UX

Avoid hardcoding – rely on ThisItem and variables

Modularize repetitive popups via components

🎯 MiniProject: Power Apps – Random Group Generator
This Power Apps canvas app allows users to randomly split a list of members (students) into two groups. The app was built using a single screen and basic Power Fx logic.

✅ Features Implemented
 Display a list of students using a collection (Members)

 Shuffle the list randomly using Shuffle() function

 Split the shuffled list into two groups (GroupA, GroupB)

 Display both groups using separate galleries

 Built entirely on a single screen for simplicity

🛠️ Logic Used
ClearCollect(Shuffled, Shuffle(Members));
ClearCollect(GroupA, FirstN(Shuffled, RoundDown(CountRows(Shuffled)/2, 0)));
ClearCollect(GroupB, LastN(Shuffled, CountRows(Shuffled) - CountRows(GroupA)));

📌 Current Data Source
Members are currently loaded from a static in-app collection via App.OnStart:
ClearCollect(Members, Table(
    {Name: "Anne"}, {Name: "Miikka"}, {Name: "Kari"}, {Name: "Marika"},
    {Name: "Markus"}, {Name: "Minna"}, {Name: "Otto"}, {Name: "Topi"},
    {Name: "Taavi"}, {Name: "Annikki"}
));

🔜 Next Steps
 Load student names dynamically from a SharePoint list

 Allow the user to specify the number of groups

 Save or export group results

 Improve UI layout and add input validation
