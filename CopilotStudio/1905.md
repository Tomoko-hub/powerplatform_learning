ðŸ“„ Copilot Studio + Power Automate Integration Log
Logging user input to SharePoint and resolving date format issues in a chatbot automation project

âœ… Overview
This project integrates Microsoft Copilot Studio (formerly Power Virtual Agents) with Power Automate, enabling a chatbot to capture free-form user input and save it to a SharePoint list.

A key challengeâ€”BadGateway/FlowActionBadRequest errorsâ€”was identified and resolved. These errors stemmed from a mismatch between expected and actual data types, specifically with a SharePoint date field.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Microsoft Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents)

Microsoft Power Automate (Cloud Flows)

SharePoint Online

Optional integration with Microsoft Teams / M365 environments

ðŸ§­ Development Flow Summary
1. Copilot Studio
Prompted the user for feedback input (free text)

Passed the value as a string parameter (Palaute) to a Power Automate flow

2. Power Automate Flow
Trigger: When a Power Virtual Agents calls this flow

Input Parameter: Palaute (Type: Text)

Actions:

Create item in SharePoint:

Title: utcNow() (current timestamp)

Palaute_pvm (Date field): formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd') âœ…

Palaute: triggerBody()?['Palaute']

Respond to the agent: A confirmation message sent back to the chatbot

Problem: BadGateway / FlowActionBadRequest
Root Cause:
A SharePoint date field (Palaute_pvm) was receiving a string value from user input (e.g. "Test feedback") instead of a valid date format

Solution:
Set the field using:

formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')
This ensures the correct ISO-formatted date is sent to SharePoint

âœ… Outcome
The chatbot collects user feedback

Power Automate logs the input and a timestamp to SharePoint

Errors are resolved, and the flow runs successfully end-to-end

ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned
Always match data types in Power Automate (e.g., Date vs Text)

Use utcNow() and formatDateTime() for precise date handling

Flow parameter names must exactly match the ones used in Copilot Studio

Flows should be named (avoid using "Untitled") to prevent linking issues

ðŸ“Œ Key Expressions Used
formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'yyyy-MM-dd')

âœ¨ Future Improvements
Branch logic based on input type or category

Send notifications via Teams or email

Enhance multi-language support using Copilot Studio's language management

âœ… Author's Reflection
Handling dates seems small but is critically important in real-world applications.
Learning formatDateTime() and understanding data types in Power Automate has built confidence for future low-code projects.

Group Generator Day2:
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To extend the Group Generator app by:

Allowing users to select the number of groups (2â€“5)

Automatically splitting students randomly into the selected number of groups

Saving group assignments to SharePoint via Patch function

âœ… Features Implemented Today
1. Dropdown to Select Group Count
Dropdown1.Items = [2, 3, 4, 5]

Users can select how many groups to create

Stored as Dropdown1.Selected.Value

2. Shuffling & Grouping Logic
Button OnSelect logic:

ClearCollect(Shuffled, Shuffle(Members));
Clear(GeneratedGroups);

ForAll(
    Shuffled,
    Collect(
        GeneratedGroups,
        {
            Name: ThisRecord.StudentName,
            GroupNumber: Mod(CountRows(GeneratedGroups), Dropdown1.Selected.Value) + 1
        }
    )
)

The GeneratedGroups collection stores:

Name: student name

GroupNumber: assigned group (1-N)

3. Dynamic Group Display
Five galleries: GroupAGalley, GroupBList, ..., GroupEGalley

Each gallery displays filtered groups:

Filter(GeneratedGroups, GroupNumber = 1)  // for group 1

4. Saving to SharePoint
SharePoint list: GroupResults

Column 1: StudentName (Text)

Column 2: GroupNumber (Number)

Save logic (continued after Collect):

ForAll(
    GeneratedGroups,
    Patch(
        GroupResults,
        Defaults(GroupResults),
        {
            StudentName: ThisRecord.Name,
            GroupNumber: ThisRecord.GroupNumber
        }
    )
);

Notify("Group results saved to SharePoint!", NotificationType.Success)

5. UI Tweaks
Color-coded group galleries

Shuffle button for regeneration

SharePoint connection confirmed via GroupGenerator and GroupResults

ðŸ§  Key Learnings
ForAll can be used multiple times in sequence

Patch is used for sending records to SharePoint

Collections (GeneratedGroups) help organize and manipulate dynamic data

ThisRecord and ThisItem help navigate current context

âœ… Next Goals
Enable reset or delete of SharePoint group results

Show timestamp / round number

Add export to Excel / PDF
